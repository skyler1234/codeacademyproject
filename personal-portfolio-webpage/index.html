      <p class="aligncenter title"><u>Discussion:</u></p>
      <p class=paragraph>The technique of using Bromine water to distinguish between an alkane and an alkene is fairly valid. The test is able to visually differentiate between the two compounds, thus it is effective. However, validity is decreased in certain conditions. Over time, the alkane may also react with bromine water via substitution. Further, if exposed to UV or sunlight, this reaction will also occur. Hence, in such cases alkanes and alkenes are indistinguishable qualitatively because both will yield the same observation: decolourising bromine water. Therefore, the bromine water test for unsaturation is fairly valid, and highly valid when the experiment is properly controlled.
      </p>
      
      <p class="aligncenter title"><u>Conclusion:</u></p>
      <p class="aligncenter special"><i>Alkenes are more reactive than the corresponding alkane, as cylcohexene reacted with bromine water demonstrated by the decolourisation of bromine, whereas cyclohexane did not react with bromine water.</i> </p>

      <h4 class="aligncenter title1"><u>Biopolymers: Biopol</u></h4><br>
      
      <p class="aligncenter special"><i><b>Describe the produced biopolymer and evaluate potential as an alternative to petrochemical products.</b></i> </p><br>
      
      <p class="paragraph"> Biopol is a developing biopolymer with high potential as a renewable alternative to synthetic polymers, due to its properties and functionality.</p>

<p class = paragraph>
Biopol is created through the bacteria A. Eutrophus. The process to manufacture Biopol is described as follows:</p><br>
      
      <ol>
        <li>A culture of A. Eutrophus is placed in a tank with a carbon source food supply, such as glucose, and other nutrients including nitrates. This allows the bacteria to grow and proliferate, allowing more efficient production of the polymer due to an increase in population.</li><br>
        
        <li>After the bacterium population is sufficient, the environment is altered to be high in glucose, high in valeric acid, and low in nitrogen. This unnatural environment, especially the restriction in nitrogen stresses the bacterium, causing it to produce the Biopol polymer PHB as a natural instinct. Since in recent production, valeric acid is used as a growth medium, the bacteria produces the copolymer PHBV, which is stronger and more flexible than original PHB.</li><br>
        
        <li>The polymer is extracted from the bacteria, and milled to powder or pellets. The polymer powder/pellets are heated to mould into a suitable shape to create a usable polymer.</li>
        
      </ol>
      
      <p class= "paragraph">Because Biopol is derived of biomass, it is renewable, biodegradable and biocompatible. These properties make Biopol a promising resolution to the use of petrochemicals, as it can potentially be sustainable if further developed, and resolves the environmental issue of global warming and climate change caused by synthetic polymers. Additionally, Biopol has high tensile strength and high melting point. It is also insoluble in water, non-toxic and resistant to acids and bases. These properties allow Biopol to be used in a wide range of applications. For example, it is used for shampoo and milk bottles due to being biodegradable, insoluble in water and having high tensile strength. Furthermore, Biopol can be used in medical applications such as sutures, staples, stents, heart valves and scaffolds as it is non-toxic, insoluble in water and biocompatible, meaning it can coexist with living tissues or organisms in the body without causing harm. Using Biopol to produce the above products can reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for the production of materials.</p>

      <p class= "paragraph">Although Biopol is a highly practical proposition, it is not currently economically viable. This is due to cumulative factors including the technical expertise, qualified management, and time required for the bacteria to grow contributes to Biopol’s expenses. The costs of production of Biopol to an industrial scale is not economically viable as of now.</p>

<p class= "paragraph">However, Biopol has high potential, and remains as a promising candidate as an alternative to petrol-based products due to its properties, in being more environmentally friendly due to its biodegradability, and sustainability due to being a natural renewable resource.</p>

      <h4 class="aligncenter title1"><u>Industrial Production of Ethanol</u></h4><br>
      
      <p class="aligncenter special">
        <i><b>Evaluate the issues involved with the production of ethanol from sugar cane</b></i></p>


<p class=paragraph>The current industrial method to produce ethanol is the fermentation of sugar cane. This production method has the benefit of producing ethanol from a renewable resource, alleviating some dependency on the increasingly scarce fossil fuels. However, this method of production also has issues, including the implications of the requirement of large amounts of arable land, the large amount of waste products produced, and the fact that this process has to rely on the use of some fossil fuels.</p>

<p class=paragraph>The first issue is that the fermentation of sugar cane requires a large amount of arable land to grow and harvest crops. This introduces various issues including competition with the food industry for cultivatable land, which may possibly result in the increase in prices of food. Additionally, the cultivation of land for the industrial scale growing of sugar cane crops can lead to land degradation, including soil erosion, salinity and fertiliser run off. </p>

<p class=paragraph>The second issue is that fermentation only produces 15% ethanol, hence a large amount of waste products is produced. The waste products are smelly and require disposal, which contribute to the issue of landfills that lead to environmental concerns of global warming and climate change. Additionally, large amounts of sugar cane crops are used to produce ethanol, meaning a large proportion is wasted, which could have been used for the food industry. However, this issue can be solved by reusing the waste products to produce ethanol. The waste product bagasse, still contains high amounts of sucrose, therefore it can be crushed and fermented into ethanol. </p>

<p class=paragraph>Finally, although sugar cane is a renewable resource, the entire process of the fermentation of sugar cane still requires the use of fossil fuels. Although this process uses less fossil fuels and is less energy intensive than producing ethanol from crude oil and catalytic cracking, the production of ethanol through fermentation is still not entirely sustainable. Fossil fuels in the form of coal is used to make fertilisers in order for the growing of crops and the replacement of nutrients from the ground after cultivation for land use. Additionally, because fermentation produces 15% ethanol, it needs to be fractionally distilled, requiring high energy input using coal. </p>

<p class=paragraph>Ultimately, although the industrial production of ethanol from sugar cane introduces various issues, it is currently the most efficient method of producing ethanol when compared to the production of ethanol from crude oil. Thus, the benefits of being derived mostly from a renewable resource, being less energy-intensive outweigh the negatives of environmental concerns, competition with the food industry and the production of wastes. </p>
